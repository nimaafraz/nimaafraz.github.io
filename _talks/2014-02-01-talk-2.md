The Telecom Special Interest group, in collaboration with the Linux Foundation’s LF Edge initiative, has published a solution brief addressing the issues concerning the centralized ID and Access Management (IAM) in IoT Networks and introducing a distributed alternative using Hyperledger Fabric.

In this lecture, you will learn about a decentralized approach to validate and verify the identity of IoT devices, data, and applications. In particular, the proposal to use two frameworks from the Linux Foundation: Hyperledger Fabric for the distributed ledger (DLT) and Hyperledger Indy for the decentralized device IDs. These two blockchain frameworks provide the core components to address end-to-end IoT device ID and access management (IAM).
