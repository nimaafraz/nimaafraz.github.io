There are two ways you can join our team as a PhD student:

### Advertised PhD Vacancies with pre-approved funding:

If you are interested in joining our team as a PhD Student carefully read the following material and make sure you keep updated with our advertised PhD vacancies.

*   [The complete PhD journey at UCD](https://www.ucd.ie/graduatestudies/researchstudenthub/phdlifecycle/): From Application to Conferring

### Secure Funding for your own PhD Proposal:

In addition to the PhD vacancies that come with funding there are other opportunities for the applicant to acquire funding for their PhD studies. The following table summurises the available funding opportunities in Ireland where we can collaborate on preparing the proposals.
